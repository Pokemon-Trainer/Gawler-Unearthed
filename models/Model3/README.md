# Model 3 - How Big Ar't Thee
This is the third model to predict which the size of mineralization in the given mineralized location. 

The dataset used to train this is the same that we used for model 2. So there is no `data_prep.ipynb` included in this folder.

You will find the saved model file [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1U4uN7YEFmr13r7ooc4mdu6BcN_yp4k_w?usp=sharing).

The model used for training is [H2o's Driverless AI](https://www.h2o.ai/try-driverless-ai/) which we used for the second model itself. You will need to start a new experiment for the same. All other instructions will be provided in the subsequent `Model3.ipynb` file.
