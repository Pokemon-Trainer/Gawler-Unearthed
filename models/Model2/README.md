# Model 1 - Tell me Thy Nameth
This is the second model to predict which mineral will most dominantly be found in a Mineralized Location. 

You can find the data-preparation part in the notebook and training part in the subsequent markdown.

You can find the saved model file and all the essential csv's [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/176Etv873RwSL-V5hBlsgKtFFasvKHK1d?usp=sharing).

The model used for training is [H2o's Driverless AI](https://www.h2o.ai/try-driverless-ai/) which is more powerful than the AutoML python implementation. Also it runs on cloud! 

It's licenced though, so you will have to get the trial version for 22 days. You'll find more information about everything in the main model-training markdown file.
